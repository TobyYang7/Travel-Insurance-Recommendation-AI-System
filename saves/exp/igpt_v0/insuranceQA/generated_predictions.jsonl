The law states that your spouse is automatically revoked as beneficiary of any life insurance policy as soon as you are divorced , even if you do n't want them to be .

The state of New York has determined that by the act of the divorce itself you are no longer legally his beneficiary .

{"label": "Prior to 2014 it was reasonable to anticipate annual increases in group and individual health insurance in the high single digits to low teen 's range . Though , of course , these are just generalized averages and a host of other factors could move rates higher or , in rarer instances , lower . We have already seen the base cost of health insurance increase fairly substantially in 2014 due to the implementation of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- . The effect was especially pronounced in the individual health insurance market of almost every state due to the mandatory addition of new benefits , the move to the community rating approach , the elimination of underwriting and adjusting rates for risk , and making all policies guaranteed to be issued without pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions . In mid-2014 we are just now beginning to receive health insurance companies filings for their proposed 2015 rates . While the rate filings vary from state to state and from insurance carrier to insurance carrier , individual health insurance rate increases in the teens to 25 % or more are being reported in many areas across the nation . In some limited instances though , you are seeing some filings requesting rate reductions but these are pretty rare . Therefore , most people should be prepared to see their rates for individual health insurance increase meaningfully again in 2015 , though this effect may be hidden to some extent for those persons who qualify for premium tax subsidies through the government health insurance marketplaces . Many small business groups are also seeing substantial rate increases in their renewal actions for the 2014-2015 benefit year . Increases of 20 % to 40 % are not uncommon .

For example, short-term plans tend to increase more than plans that meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act -LRB- Obamacare -RRB-.

Simple , right ? First , determine if the doctors , hospitals and pharmacies you want to use are in-network providers for the plan you are interested in . Second , review you health and your history of health care consumption . Your needs and usage at 27 will probably be much different than when you are 47 .

An applicant for health insurance is not subjected to any physical exams or blood or urine tests as a condition for being offered health insurance coverage . While in the past there may have been questions regarding illegal drug usage on a health insurance application that if answered truthfully by a drug user could have resulted in their being declined for coverage in the individual health insurance market we have moved past that now . As the Affordable Care Act prohibits medical underwriting and requires policies to be guaranteed to be issued regardless of pre-existing conditions there are no such questions to be answered now . Ironically , in the individual health insurance marketplace the only drug that you can be asked about and perhaps penalized for in the form of higher premiums is for tobacco use . No questions are asked about marijuana , cocaine or other drugs . This is different from applying for life insurance where in many cases a physical exam that may include drawing blood and/or taking a urine sample are part of the underwriting process . With the expanded number of states that have approved marijuana for medical usage and the outright legalization that Colorado and Washington are now experimenting with the life insurance industry is having to adjust to this changing legal environment in their underwriting practices .

Removing or reducing the financial barriers to accessing healthcare that health insurance makes possible helps create an environment where preventive care is encouraged and health problems may be detected at earlier more manageable stages .

However , those statistics come from the era when underwriting of health insurance for risk was allowed and individuals could be declined for coverage for pre-existing conditions . Starting in 2014 such practices are no longer allowed in the fully insured health insurance marketplaces and so a totally different risk pool is being created and we are essentially working on the assumption that expanding access to care will correlate with improved health care outcomes . As health care reform is easing access for some segments of our population that may have been on the outside looking in in the past , it is also raising premium costs and out-of-pocket expenses to levels that are either forcing some previously insured persons out of insurance coverage or significantly raising the out-of-pocket expenses they must incur before their coverage kicks in which may deter some people from seeking needed treatment . For this reason the jury will be out for some time as to whether our current health insurance reform efforts will yield improved health for the general population .

There are two problems which present themselves . You might really love your little Ford Focus that you bought two years ago and when it is damaged disagree with the adjuster on the value of the car . When the car is inspected the adjuster may decide that the car can not be repaired economically . The adjusted value presented will probably be less than you expected because there is a deductible which will be taken out of the settlement . Again , your full-coverage policy may not cover you in the way that you want .

{"label": "I am a huge fan of Critical Illness plans -LRB- CI -RRB- . So I 'm happy to add to the great comments above . What is covered is always defined ... . yet there are a few `` twists to look for '' . Most CI plans have moved to a `` multiple bucket '' philosophy . Most cover the `` Big Three '' critical illnesses : Cancer , Heart Attack , & Stroke . What you have to understand is if the policy is a `` One and Done '' or a `` Multiple Bucket '' plan . One and Done means that once the benefit is paid out for one CI , then the policy terminates . Diagnosed with cancer , you get the check , but there is no benefit for hart attack or stroke . A multiple bucket policy usually has a benefit for different categories -LRB- buckets of money -RRB- : Heart/Stroke , Cancer , Other . So you could be diagnosed with cancer & a benefit is paid . Then the stress gives you a heart attack & a benefit is paid . Then after all that , some `` other CI '' happens and you get a 3rd benefit . ALSO consider what the definitions are WHEN a benefit is paid . Consider an Organ Transplant benefit . Does it pay upon diagnosis and being added to the national registry or does it pay when the physical transplant is completed ? That 's a biiiiig timing difference . Also consider the `` Carcinoma in Situ '' definition and benefit amount . That 's when cancer is isolated to one tissue type -LRB- general definition -RRB- . Being smaller & localized , a Carcinoma in Situ is generally `` not as dangerous or life threatening '' . I believe all CI plans with a Carcinoma in Situ benefit pays only a percentage of the full benefit . So if you have a $ 10,000 cancer bucket , yet it 's Carcinoma in Situ , do you get 10 or 25 % of the full benefit ? Hmmmmm . OR ... does the CI plan your agent is offering even have an in Situ ??? Most have in Situ benefits . Just double check . If you trigger the in Situ benefit know that you still have the remaining percentage left in case the cancer spreads . Usually called invasive cancer . If you received $ 2500 out of your $ 10,000 when it was in Situ , you still have $ 7500 in your `` bucket '' in case things get worse . Look at the riders -LRB- additional benefits too -RRB- .

Every insurance company is regulated by the insurance commissioner in the state where the company is organized and the state where the company is allowed to transact business . This combination of state supervision is designed to make sure that each company keeps their promises . There are rating bureaus that offer information concerning various insurance companies . These bureaus generally give higher ratings to larger companies with longer histories . They are rating the financial capacity of the companies . While this is a good indicator of which insurance company to choose it is far from the only criteria . Ultimately most people buy homeowners insurance from an agent . That agent might represent one company or one hundred companies . The point is that the relationship is not with the company as much as it is with the agent . People buy insurance from people that they trust . A good agent will listen to you , provide sound financial advice and communicate clearly with you and the insurance company . The agent will propose a company . Few reject the company selected by the agent . The role of the company is to keep the promises that it makes . There are a wide range of homes for insurance companies to insure . Some companies have an appetite for homes that are in the mountains or heavily wooded areas . Other companies will not even consider such a risk . Some companies will insure homes on bluffs overlooking the ocean while others wont consider such a risk . Underwriting will often have special rules regarding roof type , location of an evaporative cooler , presence of certain pets and presence of certain types of recreational equipment . There are many reasons for some of these underwriting decisions but the agent will be able to identify the best company for you . The underwriter will try to suggest appropriate coverages . Even if you had the most highly rated company if the limits selected are not adequate , you could be left with a large loss in the event of a disaster . For example , you might have a significant amount of jewelry , photographic equipment , or musical instruments . If these are not insured correctly their loss could represent a significant financial loss for you . The most significant area of underinsuring is liability . Your agent should let you know the highest amount that the company will provide . If you choose less coverage , any loss in excess to the limit in the policy will come out of your assets . Your agent should tell you about the availability of umbrella liability coverage . A lawsuit can make havoc out of the best financial plan . Finally the way that the company pays the loss when you have a claim is the most critical factor . Homeowners claims are infrequent but tend to be severe .

Keith Prim - Dallas , TX 214-435-0791 ", "predict": "It is impossible to know with certainty how long your life insurance will last. Life insurance is a mortality insurance product that is based on the life expectancy of the insured. Life insurance companies are required to have a certain level of reserves to pay claims. If the life expectancy of the insured is longer than the life expectancy of the general population, the life insurance company may not have enough reserves to pay claims. "}

{"label": "The answer here is `` maybe '' . It really depends upon the situation and the coverage . In general , if you consider the same house and the same coverage , the homeowners coverage will cost you less . let 's start with some terms . In the industry , we usually call landlord insurance either dwelling fire , or a dwelling policy . It points to the difference between this and a homeowners policy . A homeowners policy has 6 coverages : A. Dwelling - the structure B . Other Structures - detached garages , shed 's , pole barns , etc. . C. Personal Property - Your stuff D. Loss of Use - The extra costs you 'll incur if you have to live somewhere while your home is repaired E. Personal Liability - Protects you from being sued F. Medical Payments - Pays for injuries that happen on your property without having to be sued . A Dwelling Policy , in general does n't have any coverage C , Personal Property . As a landlord , you 're worried about the building and your liability . Your tenant 's personal property is their responsibility to insure . Dwelling policies are more complicated to put together than homeowners policies but I 'll leave that discussion for another time . Lets talk about why Dwelling Policy usually costs more than a Homeowners policy . With a homeowners policy the insurance company has a greater sense of security because they only have one entity to worry about , the homeowners and their family . They have a financial interest in keeping their home safe , secure , and in good repair . With a rental property , you may have many different tenants occupy that home and they have no financial interest in the home itself . A tenant is much more likely to let things go that may eventually cause a claim . Additionally , with a homeowners policy , the liability is protecting the insured from others , with a dwelling policy , you 're also being protected from the people that actually occupy the home . Now , one last thing to mention . If you 're renting your home and it 's insured on a homeowners policy , change it now . If there 's a claim on the home and the insurance company finds out it 's being rented , they may refuse to pay your claim . Most homeowners policies require the home to be occupied by the owner for coverage to apply . Find a good agent that knows how this works and how to put this coverage together for your situation . It 's much better to know what your coverage is and make choices rather then to think you have coverage you really do n't ", "predict": "It is possible that a landlord policy is more expensive than a homeowners policy. The reason is that a landlord policy is a commercial policy and is priced on the replacement cost of the property. It also includes liability coverage for the landlord if someone is injured on the property. It also includes loss of rent coverage if the property is damaged and the tenant has to move out. It also includes a variety of other coverages that are not included in a homeowners policy. "}

If you have a mortgage and you pass away, the lender will want to be paid. If you have life insurance, the insurance company will pay the lender the amount that you owe. "}

It used to be common practice for mortgage companies to sell credit life insurance that would pay the mortgage in the case of the borrower 's death . These policies are n't sold much anymore because they were n't really a good value for the borrower . The rates were high and the death benefits fell over time with the balance of the mortgage . It 's usually a good practice to have life insurance in place to pay off any debts you have including a mortgage . To do this the right way you really need to consider the bigger picture of your life . A mortgage is just one piece of the puzzle that is your financial life . When considering how much life insurance you need , you have to determine what will happen if you die and where that will leave the survivors . Find an agent you can trust and go through the process of this planning . Nobody likes thinking about their death , but the situation exists whether you plan for it or not .

{"label": "Indemnity insurance is a form of health insurance that pays a fixed amount per service or for a period of time . For example , an indemnity policy might pay $ 50 towards a doctor 's office visit . This means that regardless of the total cost of that visit to the doctor the indemnity policy pays $ 50 . Another common example is the indemnity policy may pay $ 500 per day that the policyholder is in the hospital . If the policy holder had a 2 day hospital stay that cost $ 8000 the policy would pay $ 1000 -LRB- $ 500 x 2 -RRB- and the policy holder would be responsible for the remaining $ 7000 in hospital expenses . There are many variations on the indemnity policy theme and they are often combined with accident and/or critical illness policies to provide more financial protection . In any event , indemnity policies are not major medical policies and by design provide defined and limited financial protection to the policy holder . These policies were really designed more as a supplement to major medical insurance than as a replacement for it . If you have a premature baby that racks up $ 500,000 in neonatal intensive care bills an indemnity policy will not go very far towards covering that expense . Also , indemnity policies do not meet the Minimum Essential Benefit requirements for health insurance under the affordable care act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- and will leave such a policyholder subject to the individual mandate tax penalty if that is the only medical insurance a person has . With the high cost of ObamaCare compliant plans the lower costs of hospital indemnity plans can be a tempting option for some people but you should be under no illusion that these policies cover the full range of medical services a person might need or that they provide protection against the costs of serious illnesses or injuries that might run into the 5 , 6 or 7 figure range . ", "predict": "Indemnity health insurance is a form of health insurance that is paid for by the insured person. If you have an indemnity health insurance plan, you are responsible for 100 % of the medical bills that you incur. The insurance company will not pay anything towards the bill unless you have a deductible and/or co-insurance that you must pay. "}

{"label": "Estate planning is preparing how your estate will be distributed and minimizing/paying off applicable estate taxes upon your death . Life insurance can be used to pay the estate taxes . A common course of action people take to minimize the estate taxes they will be subject to is creating an irrevocable life insurance trust -LRB- ILIT -RRB- . An ILIT is a legal document set up to distribute life insurance proceeds in a specific manner , depending on how the trust is designed . These trusts receive special tax consideration from the IRS that is not given to life insurance policies that would otherwise be owned by a natural person or revocable trust . Since the trust is irrevocable , the terms of the trust can not be changed . An ILIT can offer many substantial advantages to protect life insurance proceeds and help you distribute your property to your children at the least possible cost . The IRS code permits a unified tax credit to pass a certain value of property without having to pay a tax . When you exceed that value -LRB- a taxable estate -RRB- , a massive tax is applied that must be paid within 9 months of death . If the decedent is single , the tax is due accordingly . If the decedent is married , the tax is due after the second death -LRB- death of the spouse -RRB- . So the question becomes , would you rather pay the estate tax with 100 % of your own money -LRB- with after-tax dollars -RRB- or would you rather pay only a fraction of the tax and use someone else 's money to pay the rest -LRB- the insurance company -RRB- . If you want the latter , you can purchase a life insurance policy . The type of policy you should set up will depend on the specific circumstances , but for many situations it will usually be a survivorship universal life policy if the proceeds are to be used for estate tax purposes . Any life insurance policy you buy will require the same premium whether you put the policy in the trust or keep it outside of the trust . If you put the policy in the trust , the death benefit is not included in the calculation of the size of the estate - a substantial tax savings and key advantage in the estate planning process . If you keep the policy outside of the trust -LRB- e.g. , as owned by a natural person or a revocable trust -RRB- , the proceeds will be included in calculating the size of the estate you may inadvertently increase the size of the estate , and be subject to paying much higher estate taxes before any of the property can be distributed to your children or other beneficiaries .

Families with a history of late-life mental illness -LRB- dementia or Alzheimers -RRB- should consider buying a larger pool of money than others , if they can afford it . It is in the best interest of the adult children to help out with long-term care premium payments if the elderly parents can not afford to pay all of the costs . Long-term care is an emotional , psychological , sociological , and family problem as much as it is financial . For the dignity of those who need care and the people or person most likely to be the caregiver , there needs to be a plan of action determined and long-term care insurance should be a part of that plan if it can be afforded and the person is medically qualified . Long-term care insurance is best purchased when young . Premiums can and will go up during the life of the policy if all the bells and whistles are included in the design of the coverage . But , those increases will seem like pocket-change if one needs long-term care . $ 80,000 per year is not unusual for facility care today . 24/7 home care can exceed $ 20,000 per month ! With family help , home care costs can be kept down . But , if facility care is required , there 's not much that can be done about avoiding high costs . Long-term care costs vary by place . The left - and right-hand coasts are the most expensive . Relocation may be necessary to get affordable care in a quality facility . ", "predict": "Anyone who has a family history of chronic illness or nursing home confinement, has a history of chronic illness themselves, is in a high tax bracket, has a large estate that they want to protect, or has a desire to leave a legacy to their family should consider buying Long Term Care Insurance.

{"label": "Your health insurance deductible is the amount that the covered individual must pay out of their own pocket before the health insurance plan begins paying for covered health care expenses . Deductibles can vary from one insurance policy to another . As an example , let 's say you have a health insurance policy with a $ 2000 deductible followed by 100 % co-insurance coverage after that amount.You are thenhospitalized for heart surgery under this policy and the total bill is $ 50,000 . You would be 100 % financially responsible for the first $ 2000 of that bill -LRB- your deductible -RRB- and the health insurance carrier would pay the remaining $ 48,000 . You have `` met '' your deductible by incurring expenses in excess of your plan 's deductible . As many healthcare providers and hospitals will tell you , there is a difference in someone `` meeting '' their deductible and actually paying their deductible expenses . So , inour example , as long as the policy holder keeps paying their health insurance premiums their health insurance will remain in effect even if the policy holder pays none or only a portion of their $ 2000 deductible amount . This is why a growing number of consumers are receiving demands for upfront payment of their deductible and co-insurance cost sharing amounts from some healthcare providers before they will provide services . I just had a friend ask me about this very situation for one of her coworkers who had recently learned she was pregnant and who was told by their OB/GYN that they wanted payment for the person 's $ 1500 deductible and their 30 % co-insurance cost sharing for the OB/GYN to provide their services to that person .

{"label": "Home Insurance contracts differ in all States ; they are all governed by the Department/Division of Insurance dictating exactly how to abide by the rules of the particular State . Once abiding by the rules of each State , carriers also have differences in handling claims and policy adjustments thereafter . In States where a Claims Free discount is allowed , the discount will be removed on the following renewal if a claim has been filed , there may also be a claims surcharge assessed in addition . Some carriers have allowances for small claims below a certain pay out whereby the insured would lose the Claims Free discount but not be assessed a further surcharge.Since it will be close to impossible to get a clear answer to this question , the following is the best rule of thumb for policyholders : DO NOT USE YOUR INSURANCE POLICY AS A CHECK BOOK ! Property Insurance is meant to protect the insured against unforeseen and unaffordable sudden & accidental perils . The home should always be well maintained and display pride of ownership for ` preferred ' risks . For example , if due to high winds a branch would be blown off a tree and simply break a window or damage a few roof tiles , this is typically not what one would purchase insurance for ; on the other hand , if there is an unforeseen electrical fault causing a house fire or perhaps the occurrence of a devastating storm , this is where insurance becomes an essential part of the recovery process . Insurance contracts are designed with a Deductible ; the deductible is the amount deducted from a Claims Payout . The actual purpose of the Deductible is to reduce the carrier 's risk exposure to small claims , the lower the deductible , the higher the premium . Clients that purchase insurance with a higher deductible make a statement acknowledging that small claims will not be brought to the carrier thus prompting the carrier to accept a lower premium for a lower risk exposure . Once a claim is filed with a Home Insurance Carrier , a claims number is assigned and the claim is reported electronically to the National Claims Database -LRB- CLUE -RRB- . The purpose of this reporting process is for the industry to share information regarding the risk thereby deterring any dishonest practices in attempting to misrepresent risk to an alternate carrier at a future point . This is a great tool that has been used for many years preventing carriers from taking on adverse risk . The answer to this question was carefully orchestrated to provide a better understanding regarding the underwriting and claims process which would lead ultimately to premium assessment . It is strongly suggested that home owners fully understand this process and contact a licensed professional to answer any further questions regarding the process .

{"label": "Congratulations ! You have asked the question that millions of Americans are struggling with and will be struggling with for years to come . Without being self-serving to my industry , find yourself an experienced and well qualified health insurance agent to shop the market for you and to explain the fine details of the options available to you . The Affordable Care Act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- has accomplished what many thought impossible - making health insurance more expensive and even more complicated to understand than it already was . Buying health insurance online , whether it 's through the government marketplaces or private sites , is not like shopping around for the best deal on a hotel room or an airplane ticket . You will encounter a bizarre world of seemingly similar looking insurance products with wildly different prices or similarly priced products with wildly different benefit designs . I guide people through this maze and it really does n't matter if they have a 10th grade education or a PhD , they are amazed at the subtle differences I have to point out that make the real differences in the health insurance products they purchase . For example , one insurance carrier here in Tennessee offers identical insurance products in the government marketplace but has three different PPO network options attached to them . The average person would look at these products , determine that the benefits are the same and so why not pick the one with the lowest monthly premium ? What they have painfully learned later is that they have enrolled in a health plan with a very narrow network of doctors , hospitals and pharmacies . The hospital a few miles from their house that they assumed was in-network because it is part of the overall health system they have been familiar with in the past turns out not to be included in this narrow network product and instead they may have to go across town or to another county -LRB- in more rural areas -RRB- to go to an in-network hospital . Another major carrier uses terms like `` Local Preferred '' and `` National Preferred '' to differentiate their products . A quick scan of the benefit summaries reveals only slight differences in office visit & prescription copays , deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums but unless you really dig deep you wo n't be able to figure out one limits your pharmacy choices significantly while the other does not . Other insurance companies whose plans people have been familiar with and even enrolled in for years have found that these company 's products have transformed into products that now require primary care referrals for visits to specialists and other services or that they provide little or no coverage outside of their immediate geographic area . Just this week I spent about 3 hours explaining his different options to a man in his early 30 's who is smart enough to run his own business and who has been my customer for 6 years . The next morning he had his mother call me so I could explain the same things to her so she could help him feel good about his final decision . This is the reality of what the average consumer is now faced with in today 's health insurance marketplace . My advice , it 's a jungle out there . Do n't go in without a trained guide and beware of these so called `` navigators '' and `` assistants '' they are unlicensed , poorly trained -LRB- perhaps good intentioned -RRB- individuals who can do little more than read the same material on a computer that you can see .

{"label": "Graded Benefit Whole Life Insurance is whole life insurance that pays a reduced benefit during the first one to three years , then pays the full death benefit after that . E.g. . If death occurred during year one or two , it may pay back all you paid in , plus 10 % . If death occurred during year three or afterwards , it would pay the beneficiary the whole death benefit . Different policies are graded a different number of years , and each carrier has their own criteria for how much is paid back during the graded years .

{"label": "That is a great question ! If you are looking at whole life insurance policies , you want to look at whether the policy is an `` immediate issue '' policy , or one that is a `` graded -LRB- or `` modified '' -RRB- '' policy . An immediate issue policy is one that goes into effect as soon as the underwriting is approved , the policy is issued , and the first payment received -LRB- in some States the policy may be honored if the company issued the policy , and the payment had not yet been received -RRB- . These policies are most often written for people with great health , or people with minor health issues , as determined by that company 's underwriters . -LRB- A good independent agent can help you find the best fit . -RRB- A graded or modified policy will be issued to folks that have more significant health issues , or by companies that are mass marketing the policy - like AARP or Mutual of Omaha 's `` guaranteed everyone qualifies '' policies that you see on TV or that arrive in your mailbox . These policies will all have a period of time where the desired face value -LRB- and typically it is very small - often not more than $ 10,000 -RRB- is not paid out unless the insured dies an accidental death -LRB- as strictly defined by the insurer -RRB- . Typically any health related passing will result in a payment only of the amount you 've paid into the policy , and some amount of interest . This period is generally 2-3 years . -LRB- Again , an independent agent can help sort through companies to help you find the best grade for you . -RRB- So an `` everyone is guaranteed '' policy like AARP offers will somewhere in the small print tell you that the policy has a graded or modified benefit period of ___ years and during that period a death resulting from natural causes will result in the return of premiums paid plus __ % interest . This is done to help limit their cost over the entirety of the risk classes they will be insuring . The other companies that offer this type of policy are doing it based upon your specific health issues , and the increased risk to your mortality . For example , someone who has no diabetes , or that has controlled their disease with a regimen like Metformin will usually be a certain immediate issue candidate . Someone whose diabetes went unchecked for a while , and is on an insulin program will more often than not be issued a graded/modified policy . If that unchecked diabetes has led to complications like amputations , diabetic coma , or neuropathy , you can usually expect the more expensive guaranteed issue policy to be your only option . Again , a good agent can help you find the best fit for you . You can expect to pay less for the immediate issue policy , more for the graded policy , and most for the guaranteed issue policy .

{"label": "Graded death benefit whole life insurance is permanent coverage that features an alternative structure in the first 2 or 3 years of the policy -LRB- depending on the insurance company -RRB- . The program will feature one of two graded benefit methods . 1 -RRB- Return of premium - if death occurs during the graded period , any premiums paid into the policy is given to the beneficiary . If death occurs under accidental means , then the full benefit is still payable . After the graded period has expired , the full benefit is payable regardless of whether death occurs due to illness or injury . Some carriers may offer interest on your premiums if the insured passes away during the graded period - be sure to review your policy to see if it 's under your policy . The return of premium structure is more commonly seen under graded benefit whole life policies . 2 -RRB- Reduced death benefit - if death occurs during the graded period , the coverage will payout a specific percentage of the death benefit , depending on which year during the graded period death occurs . For example , if death occurs during the first year of the policy , the carrier only pays 30 % or 35 % of the death benefit -LRB- depending on the carrier -RRB- - 70 % or 75 % if death occurs during year 2 . If death occurs under accidental means during the graded period , then the full benefit is payable . After the graded period has expired , the full benefit is payable regardless of whether death occurs by illness or injury . Under final expense policies -LRB- another name for small whole life policies with face amounts of $ 25,000 or less -RRB- , the responses to the health questions determine whether you will qualify for a level benefit -LRB- immediate full coverage -RRB- or a graded benefit . Typically , to qualify for a level benefit , all the health questions have to be answered no . Please note , just because you may not be able to answer all health questions no for one carrier 's program , does n't mean you would n't be able to answer no to all questions for a different carrier . Each insurance company has their own questions that they ask so one carrier may be able to consider a level benefit where another may not . The wording to the questions is critical to pay attention to . If you ca n't qualify for traditional final expense coverage , you always have the option for GUARANTEED ISSUE whole life . These programs do not ask any health questions whatsoever . They will feature the return of premium graded period . When buying any whole life insurance policy , be sure to remember 2 things : 1 -RRB- Do the premiums remain the same for the entire life of the policy ? - Some policies feature banded premium - meaning they go up every 5 years . They may be cheaper up front during the first couple years , but can cost significantly more over the long run . 2 -RRB- What age does the coverage carry you to ? - Some policies will only carry you to age 80 or to age 90 - and if you live beyond that age , your policy automatically terminates . It 's best to set yourself up with something that guarantees the coverage will remain in place for life -LRB- as long as you continue to pay your premiums of course -RRB- . I always suggest consulting with an independent agent who can shop the case for you and compare multiple insurance policies with your medical history to make sure you 're getting the desired coverage at the lowest possible cost .

{"label": "Salvage and recovery relates to subrogation and rights of recovery that an insurance company reserves for themselves after indemnifying you for a loss . The entire concept of salvage , recovery , subrogation , and indemnification fill up text books . Insurance is a contract and in the contract the insurance company has been asked by you , in exchange for mutual understandings and agreements , to provide protection against certain kinds of losses . When your insurance company indemnifies you for your loss , they replace you in position of right in many situations . For example , if your car were damaged beyond repair , the carrier pays to you the value of the car and in doing so , assumes right and title to the salvage value of your car . They sell this salvage to businesses that resell the usable parts and the insurance company uses the money they collect to lower the final dollar cost of paying your loss to you . Recovery usually relates to the right of the carrier to pursue `` recovery '' from the responsible , negligent party who damaged your car . This process is referred to as subrogating and the carrier seeks to recovery from the at-fault and negligent driver -LRB- under tort laws -RRB- all or a portion of the amounts they paid to make you whole after your loss . Another closely related provision in your insurance is the right of `` abandonment '' . Insurance companies do not grant you the right to abandon your property so you can collect a larger reimbursement . This may come up during the settlement of pairs and sets , like ear rings . The insurance company will not let you surrender -LRB- abandon -RRB- to them the other ear ring so you can make the insurance carrier liable for a larger amount so you can buy a new set of ear rings . The obligation of the carrier is to the amount of the the loss even if only a partial loss . That 's why your company will repair a car rather than pay you the full value when there is a partial loss . There are other places where salvage comes up , like in inland and ocean marine , but for the vast bulk of readers the latter answers explain how these terms impact your coverage and how your insurance company will deal with you . ", "predict": "A salvage and recovery clause is a clause in a marine insurance policy that provides for the insurer to have the right to take over the salvage of the damaged property. If the property is damaged and the insurer is going to pay the claim, they will have the right to take over the property and sell it for parts. The insurer will then use the money they get from the sale to pay the claim. "}
{"label": "When the insured receives payment of an adjusted claim , the property that is damaged becomes the property of the insurance company . Often that damaged property is of little value . However , particularly in the case of an automobile , the car may be salvaged and the insurance company may realize part or all of the adjusted claim payment . The term comes primarily from ocean marine insurance . Often a ship will have a fire in the hold . An adjuster will fly out to the ship while it is underway , evaluate the loss and the insurance company may adjust the claim before the ship even reaches port . That portion of the property that has been declared as loss becomes the property of the insurance company . There are companies that specialize in salvaged property . This is most commonly seen in the cases of ships but could apply to other forms of recovery . While I am not sure of the legal interpretation , this clause might extend to the insurance company the right to claim any gain that an insured might have on property that was declared as a total loss , and then sold to a salvage company . ", "predict": "A salvage and recovery clause is a clause in a contract that is used in connection with a sale or lease of property.

Depending upon a given group 's circumstances this may be a viable option to consider and is being done by some employers .

{"label": "This question has several answers . From a financial planning perspective , the answer is thatyou would n't . The adverse financial impact of the death of a child is relatively small . While a terrible tragedy and an absolutely awful thing to go through , technically no one financially depends on them for support . So , one of the basic tenets of life insurance - to provide lost income due to premature death of a family bread-winner - buying life insurance on a child does not make sense . While children might not need life insurance , here are some reasons why one might want to buy it on them anyway : 1 . Insure the child 's insurability - this can be achieved by purchasing a small face amount of permanent life insurance -LRB- I would recommend participating whole life -RRB- with a guaranteed future purchase option rider . The rider insures that the insured can purchase additional life insurance without the need to medically qualify . If the adult child 's health goes south , additional life insurance can be purchased . Drawbacks : a -RRB- the option usually runs out at 40 or so years old ; b -RRB- typically , only the same type of life insurance can be purchased -LRB- which can be a lot more expensive at age 30 than at age 3 -RRB- , and c -RRB- if you do n't exercise the option , you lose it . Oh , and by the way , the insured usually assumes ownership of the policy at 18 , at which time , that income-tax-free cash value can be mighty handy for the down payment on that new car . So long , insurance policy , we hardly got to know you . 2 . Provide a source of money with tax-favored access privileges - This is n't likely to work -LRB- see `` new car '' above -RRB- , but if protected by a trust with strict limits on how the cash values may be used and under what conditions it must be paid back , it could allowa responsibleadult child to be his/her own bank and/or have at least somewhere to go , independently , to cover an emergency need . The problem is that even a trust can be gotten around and the cash - and the life insurance benefit it supports - is more likely to end up being spent - and lapsed . 3 . If one feels that the death of a child could seriously impact them financially , I recommend purchasing a child rider -LRB- usually comes in `` units '' , 1 unit = $ 1000 coverage -RRB- on a parent 's term or permanent policy . Twenty-five to fifty-units should be plenty to cover final expenses and maybe some medical bills not covered by medical insurance . Using life insurance to help fund college is not the best use of the money spent over the years . There are now too many other tax-favored savings vehicles that do n't include the cost of insurance to depend on a life policy to provide a significant amount of cash over a 16 or 17 year investment horizon . In the event of the death of one child , the insurance money received as a death benefit could go to help provide some start-up college money for another child in the family -LRB- # 3 would be the least expensive way for that to happen -RRB- , but that 's kind of creepy . I think # 1 is the only prudent reason to buy insurance on a child and then only when there is a family history of childhood or adult onset of some kind of genetic malady like diabetes or cardiac problems . Otherwise , # 3 might make you feel better , but it 's not likely to be needed . ", "predict": "Life insurance for a baby is a very good idea.

{"label": "There are two issues involved in determining the likelihood of running out of money . The first is the amount of money you have accumulated to help provide retirement income and the second is the rate at which you spend that money . The return on the accumulation is important however without sufficient capital and a reasonable rate of withdrawal your retirement nest egg can be exhausted at some point . Retirement could last a very long time . Some will be retired longer than the period of time that they work .

Retirement may start unexpectedly . Waiting to start accumulating money for retirement can be hazardous . Almost forty percent of retirees report that there retirement started because of circumstances beyond their control . Losing a job after age 50 could trigger retirement as could the disability of a spouse or parent . Moving capital from your current income stream is critical to develop a retirement fund . As crucial as returns can be , unless there is a movement of capital there isnt anything for those results to work with . If you are employed you should certainly understand your employers pension plan if one is offered . Under normal circumstances the company pension plan will provide the greatest opportunity to shift capital into a retirement fund . If you are the employer there are some opportunities for you to provide for your retirement . Many of these are complicated and require expert assistance . The bottom line is that you do have opportunities . Individuals can also establish Individual Retirement Accounts -LRB- IRA . -RRB- This also applies to spouses that are not gainfully employed . The contribution is limited but if started early enough can make a significant contribution to the movement of capital into your retirement fund . You might have heard of a Roth IRA and that too can become an important part of your retirement fund but it has different rules and you should consult with a tax consultant and a Retirement Income professional about that . The second half of the issue is the way that money is withdrawn from your retirement account . This whole subject is really complex and involves a lot of decisions but the basic thing is to understand the need for a budget . Without a budget you can not set a withdrawal rate and you can not know how long your retirement fund will last . Most Americans resist budgeting but it is something that can be started easily and can be started even today . While you might not be retired you can start to record your expenses . The longer you do this the better handle you will have on your spending . The more detail you use in your record keeping the more your budget projections will increase in accuracy . There are assets that most people do not consider as they come into retirement . The first is their ability to work . If there is something that you enjoy and are good at you should prepare to move into that activity when you retire and with some planning that can be an income producing activity . This can be anything from consulting to a hobby that you love and from which you are able to earn money . Some people write some take photographs ; others sell hand made products at trade fairs . These types of activities can enhance your retirement fund by reducing the need for immediate income .

{"label": "HMO 's cover the same medical services that traditional major medical insurance plans , either group or individual cover . The essential difference is in the provider network used to deliver these benefits and how the subscriber 's access to their benefits is guided by this approach . HMO stands for Health Maintenance Organization and while there are variations on the theme , in its purest form an HMO has an exclusive network of contracted providers that must be used by subscribers to the HMO in order to receive covered services . In this context an HMO would not pay for services a member receives from a non-HMO provider . Also , HMO 's often use a `` gatekeeper '' approach that requires a referral from a Primary Care Physician before the member can receive care from a specialist or other HMO provider for non-emergency services . Theoretically the HMO concept assures that your Primary Care Physician is overseeing the member 's complete range of health care services and treatment , makes sure that care is being delivered in the most appropriate and cost effective setting and manner , and maximizes the overall efficiency of the delivery of health care to its members . In practical terms the HMO concept has generally fared best in higher population density areas that have an extensive and competitive medical infrastructure in place . One of the main reasons for this is that the HMO providers can actually be employees of the HMO or have negotiated deep discounts for their services with the HMO in exchange for a high volume of patient traffic . Accomplishing this in a metropolitan area like Los Angeles is far easier than in a rural area where there may be not be many competing providers and hospitals and these providersare already serving virtually all of the area 's population . Also , the more restrictive and controlling nature of the HMO concept has not always been welcomed by the American consumer who has been accustomed to making their own choices when it comes to selecting their doctors , hospitals and pharmacies and having a high degree of freedom in when and where they access the health care system . While HMOs can deliver excellent benefits and services at attractive rates , the potential consumer should also consider the trade offs involved in achieving these ends . If the consumer finds the HMO network to be sufficient for their perceived needs and understands therules of being an HMO member it can be a very positive environment in which to receive one 's health care .

{"label": "When this question is asked I am not sure if you mean the best insurance company with coverage 's and claims or the who has the best rates . Let 's address rates first : There is no company who has the best rates as there are many varying factors that can make one insurance company rise to the top over another as it pertains to premium . In other words who has the best rate for me may not be the best for you , and we could live right next door to each other . Now lets move on to the more important issue and that is coverage 's : What you have to understand is most insurance companies have varying options/packages of coverage 's available to purchase . In most cases agents tend to offer the cheapest package which does not maximize coverage 's that are potentially available to the client . I suggest when shopping for insurance that you truly consult with your agent about the different options available by an insurance company so you can make an educated decision on the coverage you wish to purchase and how much of the risk you yourself wish to assume . As an independent agent I am able to offer quotes and coverage 's from multiple companies to help my clients make the most informed decision about their most important asset , and that is their home . Now the next subject would be claims : Which insurance company continues to rise to the top in claims handling . There are many independent websites which you do a quick search on and find ratings on how well claims are handled and their overall customer satisfaction and loyalty . There are many companies that are great in the claims area that I bet you have never even heard of . You will also find negatives on every insurance company out there without exception . Most of the negatives are due to coverage 's not being in place that the client thought they had . Or in other words . A lack of understanding their policy . This goes back to my suggestion on being educated on the coverage 's available to you . There are many independent online reviews available to you -LRB- some good , some not so good -RRB- that will give you ratings on how well the claims experience is for clients and how insurance companies rank in the claims department . But there is one thing that I believe is very critical to the claims process and that is your agent . An absentee agent can make the process very frustrating if you are having some communication difficulty with the insurance company . An agent that is actually working for you can help make any unfortunate claims experience must less painful then it needs to be . So never take the agent out of the equation when shopping for homeowners insurance . So with all that being said , my parting advice is do your research , consult and ask lots of questions from your agent . Do n't be shy are think it 's a dumb question because it 's not . After all , were talking about your home . ", "predict": "The best home insurance is the one that is in force at the time of loss.

{"label": "My guess is that the answer to that question , `` What Should Life Insurance Cost ? '' will be different from every insurance agent you ask . Of course it depends on the type of life insurance and who the insured is , their gender , age , and health .

The thing is that while the insurance industry is highly regulated and the insurance providers have to justify their costs in order to have their premiums approved , there is definitely a good deal of variance in what the different providers charge for similar coverage . You need to realize that the insurance company is taking all the risk , and that 100 % of all clients will eventually die and therefore a claim made on their policies .

They can purchase a policy with a survivor benefit for their heirs . That policy can also have a cash account that is available to them while they are alive . They can use the money to supplement retirement ; buy a house ; fund a business ; and for emergencies Not only that : the cash receives very favorable tax treatment .

One big reason is that there is no way on earth that federal and state governments could take care of all the people that benefit from life insurance .

It is entirely in the governments interest for people to buy tons and tons of life insurance . And over time , people have .

It is called the Rule of 72 because at 10 % interest , the money will double every 7.2 years . So in order to double your Roth IRA every 7 years it must be earning just over 10 % .

Those shopping for home insurance most usually get involved in a self inflicted scam of shopping unlike products and end up making a final decision on something other than their goal ! It is very difficult to compare like coverage between insurance carriers ; thus allowing a true similar comparison . Carriers sometimes offer different deductibles , different coverage limits and different endorsement options . Depending on the customer 's needs , it is often that an important item goes unchecked in haste to complete the transaction . We recommend shopping for insurance not more frequently than once every three years and taking at least an hour to go over the coverage in detail before making a change of carrier.In today 's economy , there are clients that spend 10 - 15 minutes each and every year and simply contact someone after receiving an advertisement of a lower rate ; the topic of coverage goes untouched and the client saves $ 20 over the prior carrier 's premium . The truth will come out when there is a claim and the client questions why he/she did n't have the necessary coverage ; please do not fall into this trap - it defies the purpose of purchasing the insurance coverage in the first place . In some of these ` rush ' cases , it is also possible that following an inspection of the property , the carrier legally makes necessary changes and the client ends up with a higher premium than what they originally had with the prior carrier . It is prudent to purchase insurance at least one month ahead of the desired effective date to give the new carrier time to order an inspection and send notice of any changes which the homeowner may decide against . This would also allow you time to pay your renewal and continue with the prior carrier . The best recommendation in most parts of the United States is to try and find an insurance brokerage that represents a number of carriers ; you should call and speak to a broker explaining exactly what you 're looking for and supply a copy of your current policy for the broker to properly compare the coverage and endorsements and ask the broker to contact you if they can come up with a better offer without discounting any coverage .
